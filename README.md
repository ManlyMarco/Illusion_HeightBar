# Height (and width) Measure Bar for games by Illusion
Plugin for character maker that allows measuring of the character's height (and width) in centimeters or freedom units. It makes it easier to have consistent height of your characters and to more closely reproduce existing characters.

### How to use
1. Install the latest versions of [BepInEx v5.0](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx) and [KKAPI v1.10](https://github.com/ManlyMarco/KKAPI).
2. Download the latest release for your game. Make sure to get the right version (e.g. KK for Koikatsu, HS2 for HoneySelect2).
3. Extract the archive inside your game directory. The plugin dll file should end up inside the BepInEx/plugins folder. Overwrite if asked.
4. Start character maker. You should see two new checkboxes in the bottom right corner.
5. You can move the bar by moving the camera with right click.
6. Check plugin settings for more features (search for HeightBar).

*Note:* The height is measured from the character's origin point, which is almost always bottom of the feet. If you use ABMX to scale the feet, then this might stop being accurate. In that case check the 0 point and adjust your measurements as needed.
